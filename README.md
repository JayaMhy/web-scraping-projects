Web scraping based projects of various web services like Flipkart, Internshala, Myntra and TimesJob.

Flipkart price tracker : This is a personal project which I made for myself that sends an email when the price of a selected product on Flipkart becomes lower than the price set by me.

Myntra Scraper : In this project, I have created a scraper that collects data from myntra.com. It collects product information from different product categories for Men and Women. The data is stored in SQLite database and it has above 3 lakhs products.

Internshala Internship Scraper : This project scraps Internship information for my desired keyword in Internshala and saves the data in a CSV file. Information like JobTitle, Company, stipend, duration, etc are saved and I also get the link to more details from which I can apply.

Web scraper to scrap jobs from timesjobs.com : This is a project made using BeautifulSoup and requests library to scrap information related to jobs and save it in a text file. The code filters job posted only few days ago, asks for skills you're good at and saves jobs information based on that.
